# 1. Unload the Millenium Falcon in ONE COMMAND!
# Move the whole crew from the millenium_falcon directory into the death_star directory. HINT: * following a directory will grab all files/folders inside of a directory (directory/*)

# 2. darth_vader has defeated obi_wan! Delete poor obi_wan.

# 3.  Our heroes have disabled the tractor beam! Move the whole crew back into the millenium_falcon!
# Remember: darth_vader remains in the death_star and emperor_palpatine is still in the empire.

# 4. Move the millenium_falcon back into the rebellion directory.

# 5. darth_vader leaves the death_star to pursue luke_skywalker! Move him from the death_star into the empire directory!

# 6. Thanks to his practice back home at Beggarâ€™s Canyon, Luke blew up the death_star! Remove it from the galaxy!
